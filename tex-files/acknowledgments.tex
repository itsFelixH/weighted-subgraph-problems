I would like to express my gratitude to all those who made it possible for me to complete this thesis. First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Sven O. Krumke as well as my co-supervisors M. Sc. Eva Schmidt and M. Sc. Manuel Streicher for their professional support, assistance, and for their time.\medskip

Their office doors were always open when I had questions about my research, they were interested in my recent results, and they gave me helpful feedback and suggestions for improvements.\medskip

Special thanks go to Michelle Schulz, Oliver Bachtler and Matthias BÃ¤tjer who examined the final version of the thesis closely for correctness, English style and grammar.
