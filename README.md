# Weighted Subgraph Problems

This is a Python project for computing optimal node- and ege-weighted subgraphs on different graph classes.

The code was developed within the scope of a master's thesis at the University of Kaiserslautern. The topic of the thesis is "Complexity and Algorithms for Weighted Subgraphs".
